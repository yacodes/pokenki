# Pokenki

A tool to autotranslate selected words from KOReader `vocabulary_builder` SQlite3 database, translate them and write a `.csv` file to the Desktop.

Uses [lingva-scraper](https://github.com/thedaviddelta/lingva-scraper) as the main translation tool.

## Dismissed tools
- [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com) — asks for a credit card to obtain a free API key, unacceptable;
- [Pons](https://en.pons.com/translate) — maybe? returns weird strings with HTML, which one need to clean up;
- [LibreTranslate](https://libretranslate.com/) — self-hosted solution is cool but the quality of translations are very poor unfortunately;
- Microsoft, Google, Amazon etc — no corporate solutions are acceptable.
